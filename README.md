# reminders
 
Hello! I am super excited for everyone to see my project! 
The goal of this project is to be able to send automatic emails out from python, what you can do is take from this code and add what time you would like to send it out. Feel free to fork this code or add to it and make any changes you would like!


import smtplib 
from email.message import EmailMessage

I used the two above libraries to use their packages ^ 

I than created a function and called the function later on with my app code to be able to send emails!!




## Finished Project
